My experience ties strongly with working in team environments, often involving teams across multiple departments requiring cross-departmental communication and teamwork. With my experience into the challenges that operational workforces face and how organizations think strategically to review their progress, I strive to develop tools to simply their work through user-friendly applications that are intuitive and simple to use.",
